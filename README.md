# The Talent Acceleration Program

Welcome to the Talent Acceleration Program! You are about to embark on an intense journey towards self-discovery. What are you good at? And what could use some work? In as little as 3 months you'll find out about this and much more!

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is meant as the program's "single source of truth": the place where you record your progress, submit required coursework and receive feedback.

Here's how to make best use of it:

1. Each week starts on Sunday. The Program Director will facilitate a **Week Planning** in order to share the topics to study for the week
2. **Sync** (or clone if it's your first time) with this repository to get the latest update
3. Find and read the **Workbook** for that week
4. **Complete** your coursework and **submit** all the required files in a pull request (in a personal branch)
5. **Assign** your mentor as a reviewer to your pull request
6. Do a little victory dance because you did it!

## Learning Goals

This program is designed to be a career fast-track. It focuses on several skills (hard and soft) that will help you achieve the course's main goal: **to transition from student to professional.**

As such, here are the 4 main learning goals to keep in mind at all times:

1. Be able to speak and write English fluently (interpersonal and client communication)
2. Gain mastery of cutting edge web technologies in order to produce production grade code
3. Understand the business context of your work (i.e. customer centricity)
4. Learn how to communicate professionally in emails, meetings and presentations

## Where To Go For Help

You are always encouraged to figure stuff out yourself first. Have you gained mastery over the concepts in order to solve the challenge at hand? That said, this doesn't mean you have to struggle all by yourself.
